1.We have to go through the STM 32 discovery and all its performance analysis along with its IDE, cube programmer, ST-link utility.
we have to learn about CRC (cyclic redundency check) which is used for error detection generation on both matlab and visual studio code by using programming.
we have to learn how to implement the CRC algorithum on matlab and c programming.
Briefly study LFSR sequence, bitwise operation in c.
Here we are going to work on bitwise CRC operation, bytewise CRC operation.
